**Any signed up user can list a new space**
```
As a person
So I can list a space
I want to sign up to makersbnb

As a user(host)
So I can make some money
I want to list a new space
```
**User can list multiple spaces**
```
As a user(host)
So I can expand my empire
I want to list multiple spaces
```
**Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night**
```
As a user(host)
To entice people to rent my space
I want to provide them useful information of name, description and price for my space
```
**Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available**
```
As a user(host)
So that people can see if the space is free when they want to rent it
I want to display the dates that it is available
```
**Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.**
```
As a user(guest)
So that I can book a space for a night
I want to be able to submit a request to hire a space to the owner

As a user(host)
So that I can rent my space for a night
I want to be able to approve a request from another user to rent
```
**Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space**
```
As a user(guest)
So I don’t request to hire a space thats already reserved
I want booked nights to be marked as unavailable
```
**Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.**
```
As a user(guest)
So I don’t miss out on a space
I want to be able to request to hire a space that already has been requested by another user

As a user(host)
So I can select which booking to confirm
I want to see multiple booking requests for any given date

As user(host)
So I don’t get confused by leftover requests once I have selected one to approve
I want to decline a request to hire
```
